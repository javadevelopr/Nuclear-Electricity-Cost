		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="col-md-6">

			<p>
                      Leaving aside questions of safety and security and the associated connections to the public's acceptance of nuclear power, the practicality of nuclear power 
	in the final analysis will always depend on its economic viability in the marketplace.  Under current circumstances in the U.S., its major competitors 
	are electricity production via natural gas and wind power; and recent history has shown that, given the requirements for continued infrastructure investments needed to maintain the safety and security of existing nuclear plants, this competition in the U.S. is vigorous and challenging for nuclear power.  The obvious question is whether this is true elsewhere, in other countries, as well as whether nuclear power can be economically viable as the electricity marketplace moves away from fossil fuels altogether and existing subsidies for renewable power disappear.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	To this end, we have assembled a computational <a href="model.html">tool</a> to assess the cost of electricity based on three different strategies for the nuclear fuel cycle, assuming that the nuclear fleet is largely (or entirely) composed of Light Water Reactors (LWR): <b>Once Through</b>, meaning that 
	the used fuel is disposed of once it emerges from a LWR; <b>Limited Recyle</b>, meaning that the used fuel emerging from a LWR is processed to remove the plutonium, 
	which is then blended to produce additional fuel (viz., so-called mixed oxide fuel, or MOX) for the LWR fleet; or <b>Full Recycle</b>, also sometimes referred to as 'closing the fuel cycle', meaning that the used LWR fuel is reprocessed via an electrochemical process to produce fuel for a fast neutron spectrum, often 
	sodium-cooled, reactor (called variously a 'burner' or a 'breeder').  
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">

	<p>The computational model includes all costs involved in each of these 3 alternative fuel cycles, from the mining of uranium to the ultimate disposal; the only costs not accounted for are the avoided costs associated with the fact that the closed fuel cycle has substantially reduced spatial requirements (usually estimated as a factor of 100 reduction in storage volume) for the ultimate waste repository.
<hr>
<p>
	In order to make the cost estimation as transparent as possible, we have designed this tool so that you &mdash; the user &mdash; are able to change any and all of the key cost parameters, as well as change the estimated uncertainties for these cost parameters.  
	The nominal numbers you see were provided to us courtesy of the Nuclear Engineering Division at the Dept. of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory; more information regarding the various parameters that enter into the cost of electricity calculation is accessible by paging through this web site.  We plan to provide cost parameters for other nations; we hope that you, the user, can help us refine these cost estimates so that all of us can get a clearer picture of the economic viability of civilian nuclear power outside the United States.
We therefore encourage users outside the United States to provide such cost estimates, where available. Such data can be mailed to <span class="mail">r-rosner@uchicago.edu</span>.
